# Cognitive Sleep


Enhance your problem solving skills through sound and music, while asleep.

## Objectives:

Our **purpose** behind “Cognitive Sleep” is to promote self-experiment through our own personal cognitive therapy, allowing the possibilities which sleep, sound and music have installed for us.

Our experiment is based on Sanders, Osburn, Paller and Beeman´s (2019) research article, based on how "targeted memory reactivation during sleep improves next-day problem solving". They conducted a test whereby participants were presented with puzzles, each arbitrarily linked with a different sound. Following this, while participants slept overnight, half of the sounds associated with the puzzles they had not solved yet were presented to them. The next morning, they discovered a 55% improvement regarding participants solving cued against uncued puzzles.

Our experiment follows the same guidelines, with the difference that we provide purposefully composed soundscapes and music for the participant to reach a clearer, more fulfilling memory reactivation process. We have created Spotify playlists specifically intended for moments of _work_ and _study_, and plan on increasing the available selection soon.

## Requirements:

_* Our only requirements are for the user to download our Cognitive Sleep app and have a Spotify Premium account, though if currently without one, there's no need to worry. As part of our incentive towards fellow potential participants, we are giving out a free 1-month Spotify Premium pass with the opportunity of continuous renewal as long as the self-experiment is kept underway and the findings shared for scientific purposes._

## Procedure:

### So, how does our cognitive experiment work? 

_To begin with, choose a playlist which feels adequate for the moment you find yourself in:_

### Playlists:

- **Study**
- **Work**

_While being played, your sole task is to, if confronted with any problem or issue which can’t be presently solved, go to the app and click on the "save song" icon in order to keep a record of both the song and the time it was played._

_Cognitive Sleep will automatically save these tracks for later reproduction._
_Now, once you've gone to sleep, our app will take note of this and begin to re-play those previously saved tracks in chronological order._

### How does it know when to begin?

_The app will detect the moment in which the user has entered into deep sleep/slow wave sleep, which is the ideal moment for conducting the experiment, whereby Delta waves are spotted in its internal EEG signal software.
These tracks should be linked by now with your previously confronted issues and, as such, should allow you to go through an efficient memory reactivation process for obtaining improved next-day problem solving abilities._

## Added Features:
In addition, our music is perfectly suited for "masking" unwanted outside noises, with the possibility of generating a harmonious atmosphere within the environment one's in.
The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to increase ‘problem-solving’ skills during sleep and waking hours is gaining widespread interest as research into this area is beginning to show its many potential benefits. 

If the user is willing to help improve the current scientific knowledge concerning the topics of sleep and cognitive therapy, the data collected can be donated to further increase the knowledge available and as such, allow for a more precise, tailored work to be done for each individual case.
