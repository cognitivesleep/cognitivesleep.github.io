# Cognitive Sleep

How would you feel about increasing your problem solving skills through sound and music, while asleep?

## Objectives:

Our main objective behind Cognitive Sleep is to allow you to undergo your own personal cognitive therapy, through self-experimenting and testing the possibilities which sleep, sound and music have available.

## Our Inspiration:

Our experiment is based on Sanders, Osburn, Paller and BeemanÂ´s (2019) research article, based on how "targeted memory reactivation during sleep improves next-day problem solving". They conducted an experiment whereby participants were presented with puzzles, each arbitrarily linked with a different sound. While participants slept overnight, half of the sounds associated with the puzzles they hadn't solved yet were presented to them. The next morning, they discovered a 55% improvement regarding participants solving cued against uncued puzzles.

### Targeted Memory-Reactivation Benefits:

## Our Proposal:

Our experiment follows those same guidelines, whereby we encourage you to listen to one of our selected playlists during the day, and then have it played back at night while asleep, in order to reactivate specific targeted memory for increased next-day problem solving abilities. We provide purposefully composed soundscapes and music for you to have a more pleasant experience, and recommend you to test it at home or wherever you feel most comfortable at. We have created Spotify playlists specifically intended for moments of _work_ and _relax_, and plan on increasing the available selection soon. 

## Materials:
For this experiment you will need:

- A Laptop, Phone or Tablet
- Speakers or Headphones
- And a Spotify Premium Account

_*We require participants to have a Spotify Premium account, though if you currently don't have one, there's no need to worry. As part of our incentive towards fellow participants, we are giving out a free 1-month Spotify Premium pass with the opportunity of continuous renewal as long as the self-experiment is kept underway and the findings shared. This is simply done in order to further increase the current scientific knowledge available concerning sound and cognitive therapy)._


## Procedure:

### So, how does our cognitive experiment work? 

To begin with, you must choose a playlist which feels adequate for the moment you find yourself in:

### Playlists:

- **Work**
- **Relax**

While being heard, your sole task is to, if confronted with any problem or issue during this time, remember to click on the "save song" icon, in order to keep a record of both the song and the time it was played.

Now, before you've gone to sleep, it is important to set your "saved songs" playlist to start playback within the next few hours, by which time you should be asleep. It is important to set the volume at a low-level, since the idea is not to be woken up, but to simply receive the musical stimuli while asleep.

These tracks should be linked by now with your previously confronted issues and, as such, should allow you to go through an efficient memory reactivation process for obtaining improved next-day problem solving abilities.

## Bonus:

In addition, our music is perfectly suited for "masking" unwanted outside noises, as well as having the possibility of generating a harmonious atmosphere within the environment it is played in.
