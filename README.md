# Cognitive Sleep


Enhance your problem solving skills through sound and music, while asleep.

Our **purpose** behind “Cognitive Sleep” is to promote self-experiment through our own personal cognitive therapy, allowing the possibilities which sleep, sound and music have installed for us.

Our proposal is based on Sanders, Osburn, Paller and Beeman´s (2019) research article, based on how "Targeted Memory Reactivation During Sleep Improves Next-Day Problem Solving". They proposed an experiment whereby participants were presented with puzzles, each arbitrarily linked with a different sound. While participants slept overnight, half of the sounds associated with the puzzles they had not solved yet were presented to them. The following morning, they discovered a 55% improvement regarding participants solving cued against uncued puzzles.

Our experiment follows the same guidelines, with the difference that we provide purposefully composed soundscapes and music for the participant to reach a clearer, more fulfilling memory reactivation process. In addition, our music is perfectly suited for "masking" unwanted outside noises, with the possibility of even generating a harmonious atmosphere within the environment one's in.

_* The only requirement is for you to have a Spotify Premium account, though if you currently don’t have one, there's no need to worry. As part of our incentive towards fellow potential users, we are giving out a free 1-month Spotify Premium pass with the opportunity of continuous renewal as long as the self-experiment is kept underway and the findings are being shared for scientific purposes._

**So, how does our cognitive experiment work?
Lets give it a try...**

_To begin with, choose a playlist which feels adequate for the moment you find yourself in:_

### Playlists:

- **Study**
- **Work**

_While it's being heard, your task is to, when confronted with an issue or problem which you feel can’t be presently solved, go to the selected playlist and click the "save song" icon in order to keep a record of both the song and time._

_Cognitive Sleep will automatically save these tracks for later reproduction._

_Now, once you've gone to sleep, our app will begin to re-play those previously saved tracks in chronological order. 
These tracks should now be linked with your previously confronted issues and, as such, should allow you to go through a more efficient memory reactivation process for attaining improved problem solving abilities._


The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to increase ‘problem-solving’ skills during sleep and waking hours is gaining widespread interest as research into this area is beginning to show its many potential benefits. 

If the user is willing to help improve the current scientific knowledge concerning the topics of sleep and cognitive therapy, the data collected can be donated to further increase the knowledge available and as such, allow for a more precise, tailored work to be done for each individual case.
