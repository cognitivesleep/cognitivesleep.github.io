# Cognitive Sleep


Enabling you to enhance your problem solving skills through music and sound, while asleep.

Our **purpose** behind “Cognitive Sleep” is to promote self-experiment through one’s own cognitive therapy, allowing the possibilities which sleep, music and sound have installed for us and as such promote:
- _a state of well-being,_
- _an increase in problem-solving abilities and_
- _an overall positive effect on our quality of life_ 

We also know that sleep has a clear impact on our waking performance, as Sanders et. al (2019) said, the replay of recently learned memories during sleep putatively strengthens memory. As such, sleep-related memory processes not only strengthen but can also optimize, organize, and transform information (Ellenbogen et al, 2007). 

**So... how does it work?**

_To begin with, choose a playlist that feels adequate for the moment you find yourself in:_

### Playlists:

- **Study**
- **Work**

_During this time, you carry the sole job of, when confronted with any issue at hand which you feel you can’t presently solve, click on "save song" in order for us to keep a record of it._ 

_The app will automatically keep those tracks for later reproduction._

_Now, once your day is over and you're asleep, at some point you'll enter a particular stage of sleep in which one generally becomes more adept towards receiving and interpreting music and sounds.
Our app will take note of this, and begin to re-play those previously saved songs. 
These, in turn, now have an internal link with the issues you previously confronted with and, as such, they'll allow YOU to go through a neurological re-programming, in which you'll be able to both consciously and unconsciously seek novel ways to reach grander and clearer solutions._


The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to increase ‘problem-solving’ skills during sleep and waking hours is gaining widespread interest as research into this area is beginning to show its many potential benefits.  
If the user is willing to help improve the current scientific knowledge concerning the topics of sleep and cognitive therapy, the data collected can be donated to further increase the knowledge available and as such, allow for a more precise, tailored work to be done for each individual case.
