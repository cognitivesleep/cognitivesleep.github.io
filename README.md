# Cognitive Sleep


Enhance your problem solving skills through sound and music, while asleep.

Our **purpose** behind “Cognitive Sleep” is to promote self-experiment through our own personal cognitive therapy, allowing the possibilities which sleep, sound and music have installed for us.

Our proposal is based on Sanders, Osburn, Paller and Beeman´s (2019) research article, based on how "Targeted Memory Reactivation During Sleep Improves Next-Day Problem Solving". They proposed an experiment whereby participants were presented with puzzles, each arbitrarily linked with a different sound. While participants slept overnight, half of the sounds associated with the puzzles they had not solved yet were privately presented. The following morning, they discovered a 55% improvement regarding participants solving cued against uncued puzzles.

Our experiment utilises the same guidelines, with the difference that we provide purposefully composed soundscapes and music for the user to use as a bridge to their memory reactivation processes. As well, our music is perfectly suited for "masking" outside noises and maintaining a more harmonic atmosphere within the environment.

_Our only requirement is for the user to become a Spotify Premium user, though not to worry if you currently aren't one, since we are giving our users a free 1-month Spotify Premium pass with the opportunity of having a continuous renewal as long as the self-experiment is kept underway and the findings shared for scientific purposes._

**So... how does our experiment work?**

_To begin with, choose a playlist which feels adequate for the moment you find yourself in:_

### Playlists:

- **Study**
- **Work**

_During the time it's being played, your task is to, when confronted with a problem or issue which you feel can’t be presently solved, click on the "save song" icon in order to keep a record of the moment paired with the appropriate song._ 

_The app will automatically save these tracks for later reproduction._

_Now, once you've gone to sleep, our app will begin to re-play those previously saved tracks. 
These, in turn, should be linked by now with the problems previously confronted and, as such, allow you to go through a memory reactivation process for improved next-day problem solving abilities._


The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to increase ‘problem-solving’ skills during sleep and waking hours is gaining widespread interest as research into this area is beginning to show its many potential benefits. 

If the user is willing to help improve the current scientific knowledge concerning the topics of sleep and cognitive therapy, the data collected can be donated to further increase the knowledge available and as such, allow for a more precise, tailored work to be done for each individual case.
