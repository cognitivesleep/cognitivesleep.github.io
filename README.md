# Cognitive Sleep


Enabling you to enhance your problem solving skills through sound and music, while asleep.

Our **purpose** behind “Cognitive Sleep” is to promote self-experiment through one’s own cognitive therapy, allowing the possibilities which sleep, sound and music have installed for us and as such promote:
- _a state of well-being,_
- _an increase in problem-solving abilities and_
- _an overall positive effect on our quality of life_ 

We also know that sleep has a clear impact on our waking performance, and the replay of recently learned memories during sleep putatively strengthens memory (Sanders et al., 2019). Sleep-related memory processes not only strengthen but can also optimize, organize, and transform information (Ellenbogen et al, 2007). 

**So... how does it work?**

_To begin with, choose a playlist that feels adequate for the moment you find yourself in:_

### Playlists:

- **Work**
- **Study**

_Now that you`re listening to the playlist, you carry the sole job of, when presented with any issue at hand which you feel you can’t at present solve, click on "save song" in order to keep record of it._ 

_The app will automatically keep them for later reproduction._

_Once you ́re asleep and enter a particular stage of sleep in which one becomes more adept towards receiving and interpreting music and particular sound frequencies, our app will take note of this and begin to re-play those previously saved songs. 
These, in turn, are linked internally with the issues previously confronted with, and as such, they'll allow for a re-programming to be undertaken, in which you will be able to consciously and unconsciously seek novel ways to reach solutions._


The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to increase ‘problem-solving’ techniques during sleep and waking hours is gaining widespread interest as research into this area begins to show its many potential benefits.  
If the user is willing to help and improve the scientific knowledge concerning the topics of sleep and cognitive therapy, the data collected can be donated to further increase the knowledge available and as such, allow for a more precise, tailored work to be done for each individual and our society as a whole.
