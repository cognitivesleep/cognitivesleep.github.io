# Cognitive Sleep


Enhance your problem solving skills through sound and music, while asleep.

Our **purpose** behind “Cognitive Sleep” is to promote self-experiment through our own personal cognitive therapy, allowing the possibilities which sleep, sound and music have installed for us.

Our proposition is based on Sanders, Osburn, Paller and Beeman´s (2019) research article, called "Targeted Memory Reactivation During Sleep Improves Next-Day Problem Solving". They proposed an experiment whereby participants were presented with puzzles, each arbitrarily linked with a different sound. While participants slept overnight, half of the sounds associated with the puzzles they had not solved yet were surreptitiously presented. The following morning, they discovered there was a 55% improvement regarding participants solving cued against uncued puzzles.

As such, sleep-related memory processes not only strengthen but can also optimize, organize, and transform information (Ellenbogen et al, 2007). 

**So... how does it work?**

_Our only requirement is for the user to become a Spotify Premium user, though not to worry if you currently aren't one, since we are giving our users a free 1-month Spotify Premium pass with the opportunity of having a continuous renewal as long as the self-experiment is kept underway and the findings shared for scientific purposes._

_So, let's get started. 
To begin with, choose a playlist which feels adequate for the moment you find yourself in:_

### Playlists:

- **Study**
- **Work**

_During this time, you carry the sole job of, when confronted with a dilemma or any issue at hand which you feel you can’t presently solve, click on the "save song" icon in order to keep a register of that precise moment._ 

_The app will automatically keep these tracks for later reproduction._

_Now, once you've fallen asleep, at some point you'll enter a particular stage of sleep in which an individual tends to become more receptive towards interpreting exterior stimuli such as sound and music.
Our app will take note of this moment, and begin to re-play those previously saved tracks. 
These, in turn, should now be linked with the issues previously confronted with and, as such, they'll allow you to go through an internal re-programming, in order to become more adept towards finding novel, smarter solutions._

The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to increase ‘problem-solving’ skills during sleep and waking hours is gaining widespread interest as research into this area is beginning to show its many potential benefits. 

If the user is willing to help improve the current scientific knowledge concerning the topics of sleep and cognitive therapy, the data collected can be donated to further increase the knowledge available and as such, allow for a more precise, tailored work to be done for each individual case.
