# Cognitive Sleep

How would you feel about increasing your problem solving skills through sound and music, while asleep?

## Objectives:

Our main objective behind “Cognitive Sleep” is to allow you to undergo your own personal cognitive therapy, through self-experimenting and testing the possibilities which sleep, sound and music have prepared for us.

## Our Inspiration:

Our experiment is based on Sanders, Osburn, Paller and Beeman´s (2019) research article, based on how "targeted memory reactivation during sleep improves next-day problem solving". They conducted an experiment whereby participants were presented with puzzles, each arbitrarily linked with a different sound. While participants slept overnight, half of the sounds associated with the puzzles they hadn't solved yet were presented to them. The next morning, they discovered a 55% improvement regarding participants solving cued against uncued puzzles.

Our experiment follows those same guidelines, whereby participants are encouraged to listen to one of our selected playlists during the day, and then hear it back at night while asleep, in order to reactivate specific targeted memory. In our case, we provide purposefully composed soundscapes and music for the participant to have a richer, more fulfilling process. We have created Spotify playlists specifically intended for moments of _work_ and _relax_, and plan on increasing the available selection soon. 

## Materials:
For this experiment you will need:

- A Laptop, Phone or Tablet
- Speakers or Headphones
- And a Spotify Premium Account

_*We require participants to have a Spotify Premium account, though if you're currently without one, there's no need to worry. As part of our incentive towards fellow porticipants, we are giving out a free 1-month Spotify Premium pass with the opportunity of continuous renewal as long as the self-experiment is kept underway and the findings shared with us. This is done in order to further increase the current scientific knowledge available surrounding the topic at hand)._

## Procedure:

### So, how does our cognitive experiment work? 

_To begin with, you must choose a playlist which feels adequate for the moment you find yourself in:_

### Playlists:

- **Work**
- **Relax**

_While being heard, your sole task is to, if confronted with any problem or issue during this time, remember to click on the "save song" icon, in order to keep a record of both the song and the time it was played._ 

_Now, before you've gone to sleep, it is important to set your "saved songs" playlist to start playback whilst you're (ideally) during deep sleep. It is important to keep the music at a low-volume, since the idea is not to be woken up, but to simply receive the musical stimuli without being conscious about it.

_These tracks should be linked by now with your previously confronted issues and, as such, should allow you to go through an efficient memory reactivation process for obtaining improved next-day problem solving abilities._

## Added Features:
_In addition, our music is perfectly suited for "masking" unwanted outside noises, as well as having with the possibility of generating a harmonious atmosphere within the environment one's in._

The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to increase ‘problem-solving’ skills during sleep and waking hours is gaining widespread interest as research into this area is beginning to show its many potential benefits.
