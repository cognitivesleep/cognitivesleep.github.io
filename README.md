# Cognitive Sleep


Enabling you to enhance your problem solving skills through music and sound, while asleep.

Our **purpose** behind “Cognitive Sleep” is to promote self-experiment through individual cognitive therapy, allowing the possibilities which sleep, music and sound have installed for us to occur and as such promote:
- _a clearer focus on our daily activities,_
- _an unconscious reorganization of our thought patterns and_
- _an increase in our overall problem-solving abilities_

We also know that sleep has a clear impact on our waking performance, as Sanders et. al (2019) said, the replay of recently learned memories during sleep putatively strengthens memory. As such, sleep-related memory processes not only strengthen but can also optimize, organize, and transform information (Ellenbogen et al, 2007). 

**So... how does it work?**

_To begin with, choose a playlist that feels adequate for the moment you find yourself in:_

### Playlists:

- **Study**
- **Work**

_During this time, you carry the sole job of, when confronted with a dilemma or any issue which you feel you can’t presently solve, click on "save song" in order for us to keep a record of it._ 

_The app will automatically keep these tracks for later reproduction._

_Now, once your day is over and you're asleep, at some point you'll enter a particular stage of sleep in which an individual tends to become more open towards receiving and interpreting music and information.
Our app will take note of this, and begin to re-play those previously saved songs. 
These, in turn, now have an emotional link with the issues previously confronted and, as such, they'll allow YOU to go through a neurological re-programming, in which both consciously and unconsciously you'll be more apt towards finding novel ways to obtain smarter, clearer solutions._


The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to increase ‘problem-solving’ skills during sleep and waking hours is gaining widespread interest as research into this area is beginning to show its many potential benefits.  
If the user is willing to help improve the current scientific knowledge concerning the topics of sleep and cognitive therapy, the data collected can be donated to further increase the knowledge available and as such, allow for a more precise, tailored work to be done for each individual case.
