# Cognitive Sleep


Enhancing your problem solving skills through sound and music, while asleep.

## Objectives:

Our **purpose** behind “Cognitive Sleep” is to promote self-experiment through each participants' own personal cognitive therapy, by exploring the opportunities which sleep, sound and music have for us.

Our experiment is based on Sanders, Osburn, Paller and Beeman´s (2019) research article, based on how "targeted memory reactivation during sleep improves next-day problem solving". They conducted an experiment whereby participants were presented with puzzles, each arbitrarily linked with a different sound. While participants slept overnight, half of the sounds associated with the puzzles they hadn't solved yet were presented to them. The next morning, they discovered a 55% improvement regarding participants solving cued against uncued puzzles.

So, our experiment follows the same guidelines, with the difference that we provide purposefully composed soundscapes and music for the participant to have a richer, more fulfilling memory reactivation process. We have created Spotify playlists specifically intended for moments of _work_ and _relax_, and plan on increasing the available selection soon. 

## Materials:
For this experiment you will need:

- Laptop, Phone or Tablet
- Speakers or Headphones
- Spotify Premium Account
* We require the user to have a Spotify Premium account, though if currently without one, there's no need to worry. As part of our incentive towards fellow potential participants, we are giving out a free 1-month Spotify Premium pass with the opportunity of continuous renewal as long as the self-experiment is kept underway and the findings shared with us for scientific purposes._

## Procedure:

### So, how does our cognitive experiment work? 

_To begin with, choose a playlist which feels adequate for the moment you find yourself in:_

### Playlists:

- **Work**
- **Relax**

_While being heard, your sole task is to, if confronted with any problem or issue during this time, remember to click on "save song", in order to keep a record of both the song and the time it was played._

_Now, once you've gone to sleep, remember to set your "saved songs" playlist to commence during your sleeping hours. It is important to keep it at a low-volume, since the idea is not to be woken up, but to simply be receiving the musical stimuli without one being conscious about it.

_These tracks should be linked by now with your previously confronted issues and, as such, should allow you to go through an efficient memory reactivation process for obtaining improved next-day problem solving abilities._

## Added Features:
In addition, our music is perfectly suited for "masking" unwanted outside noises, with the possibility of generating a harmonious atmosphere within the environment one's in.
The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to increase ‘problem-solving’ skills during sleep and waking hours is gaining widespread interest as research into this area is beginning to show its many potential benefits. 

If the user is willing to help improve the current scientific knowledge concerning the topics of sleep and cognitive therapy, the data collected can be donated to further increase the knowledge available and as such, allow for a more precise, tailored work to be done for each individual case.
