# Cognitive Sleep


Enhance your problem solving skills through sound and music, while asleep.

## Objectives:

Our **purpose** behind “Cognitive Sleep” is to promote self-experiment through our own personal cognitive therapy, allowing the possibilities which sleep, sound and music have installed for us.

Our experiment is based on Sanders, Osburn, Paller and Beeman´s (2019) research article, based on how "Targeted memory reactivation during sleep improves next-day problem solving". They conducted a test whereby participants were presented with puzzles, each arbitrarily linked with a different sound. Following this, while participants slept overnight, half of the sounds associated with the puzzles they had not solved yet were presented to them. The next morning, they discovered a 55% improvement regarding participants solving cued against uncued puzzles.

Our experiment follows the same guidelines, with the difference that we provide purposefully composed soundscapes and music for the participant to reach a clearer, more fulfilling memory reactivation process. We have created Spotify playlists specifically related to the areas of _work_ and _study_, and plan on increasing the available selection soon. In addition, our music is perfectly suited for "masking" unwanted outside noises, with the possibility of generating a harmonious atmosphere within the environment one's in.

## Requirements:

_* Our only requirement is for the user to have a Spotify Premium account, though if currently without one, there's no need to worry. As part of our incentive towards fellow potential participants, we are giving out a free 1-month Spotify Premium pass with the opportunity of continuous renewal as long as the self-experiment is kept underway and the findings shared for scientific purposes._

**So, how does our cognitive experiment work?
Let's give it a try...**

_To begin with, choose a playlist which feels adequate for the moment you find yourself in:_

### Playlists:

- **Study**
- **Work**

_While being played, your sole task is to, if confronted with any problem or issue which can’t be presently solved, go to the app and click on the "save song" icon in order to keep a record of both the song and the time it was played._

_Cognitive Sleep will automatically save these tracks for later reproduction._

_Now, once you've gone to sleep, our app will begin to re-play those previously saved tracks in chronological order. 
These tracks should now be linked with your previously confronted issues and, as such, should allow you to go through an efficient memory reactivation process for obtaining improved next-day problem solving abilities._


The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to increase ‘problem-solving’ skills during sleep and waking hours is gaining widespread interest as research into this area is beginning to show its many potential benefits. 

If the user is willing to help improve the current scientific knowledge concerning the topics of sleep and cognitive therapy, the data collected can be donated to further increase the knowledge available and as such, allow for a more precise, tailored work to be done for each individual case.
