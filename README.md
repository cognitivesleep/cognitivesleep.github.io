# Cognitive Sleep


Enhance your problem solving skills through sound and music while asleep. Ready?


**So... how does it work?**

_Choose a playlist that feels adequate for the moment you find yourself in:_

### Playlists:

- **Study**
- **Work**

_Once the playlist is selected and being reproduced, you carry the sole job of, when confronted with an issue at hand which can’t be presently solved, click on "save song" in order to keep hold of the songs which were being heard at those particular moments._ 

_The app will automatically keep them for later reproduction. 
Once you ́re asleep and enter a particular stage of sleep in which you’re more open to receiving and interpreting music and sound frequencies, our app will take note of this and begin to re-play those previously saved songs. 
These, in turn, are now linked internally with the issues previously raised, and as such, they will allow for a re-programming to be undertaken, in which you will consciously and unconsciously seek novel ways to solve the issues previously raised._



Our **purpose** behind “Cognitive Sleep” is to self-experiment and promote one’s own cognitive therapy, by using the possibilities which sleep, sound and music have installed for us, and as such promote a state of well-being, increasing our problem-solving abilities and having an overall positive effect on our quality of life. 

The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to increase ‘problem-solving’ techniques during sleep and waking hours is gaining widespread interest as research into this area begins to show its many potential benefits.  
If the user is willing to help and improve the scientific knowledge concerning the topics of sleep and cognitive therapy, the data collected can be donated to further increase the knowledge available and as such, allow for a more precise, tailored work to be done for each individual and our society as a whole.
