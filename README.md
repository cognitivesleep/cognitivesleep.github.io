# Cognitive Sleep

How would you feel about increasing your problem solving skills through sound and music, while asleep?

## Objectives:

Our main objective behind Cognitive Sleep is to allow you to undergo your own personal cognitive therapy, through self-experimenting and testing the possibilities which sleep, sound and music have to offer.

## Our Inspiration:

We propose an experiment based on Sanders, Osburn, Paller and Beeman´s (2019) research article, called "targeted memory reactivation during sleep improves next-day problem solving". They conducted an experiment whereby participants were presented with puzzles, each arbitrarily linked with a different sound. While participants slept overnight, half of the sounds associated with the puzzles they hadn't solved yet were presented to them. The next morning, they discovered a 55% improvement regarding participants solving cued against uncued puzzles.

### Targeted Memory-Reactivation Benefits:

- Optimize and organize information
- Strengthen and potentially transform memory 
- Improved learning and problem-solving skills 

## Our Proposal:

Our experiment follows those same guidelines, whereby we encourage you to listen to one of our selected playlists during the day, and then have it played back at night while asleep, in order to reactivate specific targeted memory for increased next-day problem solving abilities. We provide purposefully composed soundscapes and music for you to have a more pleasant experience, and recommend you to test it at home or wherever you feel most comfortable at. We have created Spotify playlists specifically intended for moments of _work_ and _relax_, and plan on increasing the available selection soon. 

## Materials:
For this experiment, you will need:

- A Laptop, Phone or Tablet
- Speakers or Headphones
- And a Spotify Premium Account

_*We require participants to have a Spotify Premium account, though if you currently don't have one, there's no need to worry. As part of our incentive towards fellow participants, we are giving out a free 1-month Spotify Premium pass with the opportunity of continuous renewal as long as the self-experiment is kept underway and the findings shared. This is simply done in order to further increase the current scientific knowledge available concerning sound and cognitive therapy)._


## Procedure:

### So, how does our cognitive experiment work? 

To begin with, you must choose a playlist which feels adequate for the moment you find yourself in:

### Playlists:

- **Work**
- **Relax**

While being heard, your sole task is to, if confronted with any problem or issue during this time, remember to click on the "save song" icon, in order to keep a record of both the song and the time it was played.

Now, before you've gone to sleep, it is important to set your "saved songs" playlist to start playback within the next 4-5 hours, by which time you should be ideally in deep slow-wave sleep (SWS). 

### Why is this?

Subsequently delivering the cues again during slow-wave sleep (SWS) produces better learning compared with control conditions (Rasch, Büchel, Gais, & Born, 2007). Prior TMR studies demonstrate memory strengthening and reorganization using cues presented during SWS (Hu, Cheng, Chiu, & Paller, 2019).

### Final things to consider:

It is important to set the volume at a low-level, since the idea is not to be woken up, but to simply receive the musical stimuli while asleep.
These tracks should be linked by now with your previously confronted issues and, as such, should allow you to go through an efficient memory reactivation process for obtaining improved next-day problem solving abilities.

## Bonus:

In addition, our playlists are perfectly usable for using as "blockers" of unwanted outside noises, as well as having the possibility of fomenting a harmonious atmosphere within the environment one's in.
