# Cognitive Sleep


Enhance your problem solving skills through music and sound, while asleep.

Our **purpose** behind “Cognitive Sleep” is to promote self-experiment through our own personal cognitive therapy, allowing the possibilities which sleep, music and sound have installed for us and as such promote:
- _a clearer focus on our activities,_
- _an unconscious reorganization of our thought patterns and_
- _an increase in our memory capacity and problem-solving abilities_

We also know that sleep has a clear impact on our waking performance, as Sanders et. al (2019) recently said, the replay of recently learned memories during sleep putatively strengthens memory. As such, sleep-related memory processes not only strengthen but can also optimize, organize, and transform information (Ellenbogen et al, 2007). 

**So... how does it work?**

_To begin with, choose a playlist which feels adequate for the moment:_

### Playlists:

- **Study**
- **Work**

_During this time, you carry the sole job of, when confronted with a dilemma or any issue at hand which you feel you can’t presently solve, click on the "save song" icon in order for us to keep register of it._ 

_The app will automatically keep these tracks for later reproduction._

_Now, once you've gone to sleep, at some point it's likely you'll enter a particular stage of sleep in which an individual tends to become more open towards receiving and interpreting music and information.
Our app will take note of this, and begin to re-play those previously saved songs. 
These, in turn, have an emotional link with the issues previously confronted with and, as such, they'll allow YOU to go through a re-programming, in which both consciously and unconsciously you'll be more adept towards finding novel ways to obtain smarter, clearer solutions._


The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to increase ‘problem-solving’ skills during sleep and waking hours is gaining widespread interest as research into this area is beginning to show its many potential benefits.  
If the user is willing to help improve the current scientific knowledge concerning the topics of sleep and cognitive therapy, the data collected can be donated to further increase the knowledge available and as such, allow for a more precise, tailored work to be done for each individual case.
