# Cognitive Sleep

Increase your problem solving skills through sound and music, while asleep!

## Objectives:

Our main objective behind Cognitive Sleep is to allow you to undergo your own personal cognitive therapy, through self-experimenting and testing the possibilities which sleep, sound and music have to offer. As such, we intend to give you the necessary tools and information available in order to allow you to undergo your personal targeted-memory reactivation process for improving your next-day problem solving abilities.

### Targeted Memory-Reactivation Benefits:

- Optimize and organize information
- Strengthen your memory
- And improve your learning and problem-solving skills 

## Our Inspiration: 

We propose this experiment based on by Sanders, Osburn, Paller and Beeman´s (2019) research article, called "targeted memory reactivation during sleep improves next-day problem solving". Simply put, they conducted an experiment whereby participants were presented with puzzles, each arbitrarily linked with a different sound. During the course of the day, participants had to try and solve the puzzles they were presented with. Once they had a total of 6 unsolved puzzles each, the research conductors stopped the activity and kept a record of them. 

While participants slept overnight, half of the sounds associated with the puzzles they hadn't solved yet were presented to them, as such making them go through targeted sound reinforcement memory reactivation during their sleep. The next morning, they discovered there was a 55% improvement regarding participants solving cued (with sound reinforcement) against uncued puzzles, which means that sound reinforcement during sleep did have a positive effect on their next-day problem solving abilities.

## Our Proposal:

Our experiment follows these same guidelines, whereby we encourage you to listen to our selected playlists during the day and then have you choose those tracks which you heard during a certain "puzzling" moment, and have them played back at night while you're asleep. This is done in order to reactivate those specific moments of your day which you feel need further working on.

We provide purposefully composed soundscapes and music for you to have a more rewarding experience, and recommend you test this experiment at home or wherever it is that you feel most comfortable at. We have created Spotify playlists specifically intended for moments of _work_ and _relax_, and plan on increasing the available selection soon.

## Materials:
For this experiment, you will need:

- A Laptop, Phone or Tablet;
- A Sleep Monitoring and Cueing System (SMCS), provided by us; 
- And a Spotify Premium Account*, which may also be provided by us. 

_*If you currently don't have a Spotify Premium Account, there's no need to worry. As part of our incentive towards fellow participants, we are giving out a free 1-month Spotify Premium pass with the opportunity of continuous renewal as long as the self-experiment is kept underway and the findings shared. This is simply done in order to further increase the current scientific knowledge available concerning sound and cognitive therapy._

## Procedure:

### So, how does our experiment work? 

To start off, choose a playlist which feels adequate for the moment you find yourself in:

### Playlists:

- **Work**
- **Relax**

Upon hearing it, your sole task is to, if confronted with any problem or issue during this time, go to your playback device and click on the "add to playlist" icon, in order to keep a record of both the song and the time it was played at.

Now, before you've gone to sleep, it is important to set your phone or laptop on a level surface near your bed, which in turn should be connected to the SMCS. This will read your brain activity during sleep to determine your sleep stage, and it will automatically begin playing your saved playlist once it detects you've entered slow-wave sleep (SWS).

### Why is the SWS phase recommended?

_Subsequently delivering cues during SWS produces better learning compared with control conditions (Rasch, Büchel, Gais, & Born, 2007). In addition, prior TMR studies demonstrated memory strengthening and reorganization using cues presented during SWS (Hu, Cheng, Chiu, & Paller, 2019)._ 

Furthermore, it is important to set the volume at a low-level, since the idea is not to be woken up, but to simply receive the musical stimuli while asleep. The playlist will commence with our "pink noise" track, in order to reduce the likelihood that the other tracks will provoke arousal. If, by any chance, you are woken up by our tracks, simply press "Stop" in order to pause all incoming sounds, and the SMCS will reactivate the playlist once it detects you've entered SWS again.

## Our Predictions:

We hope that these tracks are linked by now with your previously confronted issues and, as such, should allow you to go through an efficient memory reactivation process for obtaining improved next-day problem solving abilities. 
Our experiment is based on citizen science fundamentals, whereby we encourage public participation and collaboration in our research, and the information gathered is then utilized for further increasing the current scientific knowledge available.

### Bonus:

In addition, our playlists are perfectly suitable for "masking" unwanted outside noises, as well as having the possibility of fomenting a harmonious atmosphere within the environment you're in.
