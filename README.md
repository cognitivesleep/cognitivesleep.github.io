# Welcome to Cognitive Sleep

Enhance your problem solving abilities through sound and music during sleep time. Ready?

### Playlists:

- **Study**
- **Relax**
- **Sleep**
- **Meditate**
- **Excercise**
- **Chill**

Our purpose with “Cognitive Sleep” is to enhance our cognitive abilities through the use of sound and music being played for us during our sleeping hours. 

[link] How does it work?

Choose a playlist that feels adequate for the moment you find yourself in; i.e “chill” playlist during your working hours since you ́re looking to generate a calm and relaxing atmosphere.
 
Once the playlist is selected and being reproduced, you carry the sole job of, when confronted with an issue at hand which can’t be presently solved, write down the songs which were being heard at those precise moments. 

Once work is finished, remember to save those songs and the app will automatically keep them for later reproduction. 

Finally, once you ́re asleep and enter a particular stage of sleep in which you’re more open to receiving sound frequencies, our “Cognitive Sleep” app will begin to re-play those previously saved songs. These, in turn, are now linked internally within yourself with the issues previously raised during work, and as such, they will allow for a re-programming to be undertaken, in which you will consciously and unconsciously seek novel ways to solve the issues previously raised.   

Our idea behind “Cognitive Sleep” is to self-experiment and promote one’s own cognitive therapy, by using the possibilities which sleep, sound and music have installed for us, and as such promote a state of well-being, increasing our problem-solving abilities and having an overall positive effect on our quality of life. 

If the user is willing to help and improve the scientific knowledge concerning the topics of sleep and cognitive therapy, the data collected can be donated to further increase the knowledge available and as such, allow for a more precise, tailored work to be done for each individual and society as a whole.
