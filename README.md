# Cognitive Sleep

Increase your problem solving skills through sound and music, while asleep

## Objectives:

Our main objective behind Cognitive Sleep is to allow you to undergo your own personal cognitive therapy, through self-experimenting and testing the possibilities which sleep, sound and music have to offer.

## Our Inspiration:

We propose an experiment based on Sanders, Osburn, Paller and Beeman´s (2019) research article, called "targeted memory reactivation during sleep improves next-day problem solving". They conducted an experiment whereby participants were presented with puzzles, each arbitrarily linked with a different sound. While participants slept overnight, half of the sounds associated with the puzzles they hadn't solved yet were presented to them. The next morning, they discovered a 55% improvement regarding participants solving cued against uncued puzzles.

### Targeted Memory-Reactivation Benefits:

- Optimize and organize information
- Strengthen your memory and
- Improve your learning and problem-solving skills 

## Our Proposal:

Our experiment follows the same guidelines, whereby we encourage you to listen to one of our selected playlists during the day, and then have it played back at night while asleep, in order to reactivate specific targeted memory for increased next-day problem solving abilities. We provide purposefully composed soundscapes and music for you to have a more pleasant experience, and recommend you to test it at home or wherever you feel most comfortable at. We have created Spotify playlists specifically intended for moments of _work_ and _relax_, and plan on increasing the available selection soon. 

## Materials:
For this experiment, you will need:

- A Laptop, Phone or Tablet
- Speakers or Headphones
- And a Spotify Premium Account

_*We require participants to have a Spotify Premium account, though if you currently don't have one, there's no need to worry. As part of our incentive towards fellow participants, we are giving out a free 1-month Spotify Premium pass with the opportunity of continuous renewal as long as the self-experiment is kept underway and the findings shared. This is simply done in order to further increase the current scientific knowledge available concerning sound and cognitive therapy._


## Procedure:

### So, how does our experiment work? 

To start off, choose a playlist which feels adequate for the moment you find yourself in:

### Playlists:

- **Work**
- **Relax**

Upon hearing it, your sole task is to, if confronted with any problem or issue during this time, go to your phone, tablet, etc and click on the "add to playlist" icon, in order to keep a record of both the song and the time it was played at.

Now, before you've gone to sleep, it is important to set your recently made playlist to start playback within the next 2 to 3 hours, by which time you should ideally be in deep slow-wave sleep (SWS). 

### Why is this stage recommended?

Subsequently delivering cues during SWS produces better learning compared with control conditions (Rasch, Büchel, Gais, & Born, 2007). Besides, prior TMR studies demonstrated memory strengthening and reorganization using cues presented during SWS (Hu, Cheng, Chiu, & Paller, 2019). Although this is said, there are many variables involved in reaching and measuring this stage of sleep. For this reason, we simply inform the participants about it, but our intention is not to identify which sleep stage is most important but rather to determine generally whether sleep can be more strongly linked with problem solving.

### Final things to consider:

It is important to set the volume at a low-level, since the idea is not to be woken up, but to simply receive the musical stimuli while asleep. These tracks should be linked by now with your previously confronted issues and, as such, should allow you to go through an efficient memory reactivation process for obtaining improved next-day problem solving abilities. 

## Bonus:

In addition, our playlists are perfectly suitable for "masking" unwanted outside noises, as well as having the possibility of fomenting a harmonious atmosphere within the environment you're in.

Our experiment is based on citizen science fundamentals, whereby the practice of public participation and collaboration in scientific research are utilized to increase the current scientific knowledge available. As such, this allows a more precise, accurate understanding of the topic at hand.
